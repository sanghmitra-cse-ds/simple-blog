				<p>The morning started the way it always does — with coffee and a hesitation about leaving the blanket. But the street held a clear, cool light and a promise. I walked slowly and noticed the ordinary like it was made for me: dew catching the sun, a paper boat stuck in a gutter, a cat that stretched and decided to follow for a block.</p>

				<p>At a corner, an elderly woman tied a bright ribbon on a lamppost and smiled like she had completed a task for the day. There was no dramatic lesson, only a steady string of small things that made the walk feel meaningful: an old song from a distant radio, a bakery's first tray of warm buns. Later I realized how rare it is to slow down enough to collect these moments.</p>
