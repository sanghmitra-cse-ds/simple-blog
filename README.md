## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone or download the project folder.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the folder with a static server (e.g. `npx serve` or `python -m http.server`).
3. Customize the content and styles in the files below.

## 📁 Files added / modified

- index.html — Homepage with blog previews
- blog-post.html — Single post template
- about.html — About page
- styles/style.css — All styles (variables, layout, responsive rules)
- images/ — Place your images here (use 1200x800 for hero, 600x400 for thumbnails)

## 🛠 Development tips

- Change color variables in `styles/style.css` under `:root`.
- Duplicate `blog-post.html` to add more posts, or create a simple templating workflow.
- For local development, run a static server so relative images and links behave consistently.

## 🎨 Customization Tips

- Modify colors in `style.css` under the `:root` variables.
- Replace images inside the `/images` directory.
- Add more blog posts by copying the `blog-post.html` template.
